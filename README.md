# TODO List Web Application

This is a simple TODO List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. It uses **localStorage** to store tasks, so they persist even after the browser is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the TODO list.
- **Mark Tasks as Done**: Tasks can be marked as completed by checking the checkbox.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: All tasks are stored in the browser’s localStorage, ensuring the list remains intact after a page refresh.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the basic structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the TODO list interface.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features like adding, deleting, and toggling tasks.
- **localStorage**: To persist the list of tasks locally in the browser.
